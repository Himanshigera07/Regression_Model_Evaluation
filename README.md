# 🏠 Regression Model Evaluation

This project demonstrates a regression task using a housing prices dataset.
The goal is to predict continuous numerical values based on features such as area, rooms, and location.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains real estate data with features like:
- Area
- Number of rooms
- Location
- Price (target variable)

## ✅ Workflow
1. Handle Missing Values
2. Encode Categorical Features
3. Normalize/Standardize Numeric Features
4. Feature Engineering
5. Train Regression Models (e.g., Linear Regression)
6. Evaluate with:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score
7. Visualize Regression Predictions

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics (Achieved)

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 2248.03  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 10016090.99  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 3164.82  
- **R² Score:** 0.8731

These metrics indicate that the model explains approximately 87% of the variance in the target variable.
